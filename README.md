### Decentralised Application by Government to offer various public services


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Servvify** is a devcentralised application by government/corporations to offer various rewards, services to people using Blockchain and cryptocurrency. This DApp is designed for people of all levels of expertise, ages. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Blockchain and Crypto newbies can easily use this DApp without much efforts. Main bottle neck problems for crypto and blockchain mass adoption are requirements like Wallet, Huge alphanumeric address, Gas fee, Transaction speed and buying crypto in the first place. Solutions to all these key issues are addressed in this DApp thus making it **frinedly for newbies and even experienced ones**.

## Features of Servvify
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Servvify is a proof of concept of how government's can introduce blockchain and crypto based applications to larger audience from different backgrounds. In this DApp specifically I have implemented 2 features for reward distribution and payments.
   - Ecogift
   - Pay
   
# Ecogift
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ecogift is a reward distribution page inside Servvify for waste management. Idea is Government spends lot of money and resources to manage waste daily. We can drastically cut down this cost if we properly reuse,recycle waste. This can happen if waste is dumped categorically like All plastic in one bin, Metal in another bin, Degradable waste in other bin and so on. If we can segregate waste at User level itself it greatly saves money on logistics and processing for governments. 
   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But people will be reluctant to dump categorically. This is where we can reward them some crypto so that they can feel like this little act can help them earn something. Government can provide several services, paying bills option with this reward which brings lot of People onboard. Everything is fine but how do we reward them quickly, without change in earnings in middle? This is where **Smart Contracts** come in. I have included a smart contract to automate reward distribution once User dumps categorically. This can be observed in Video.
   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Flow of this shall be**<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - User enters his address( but difficult for newbies. this is where we introduce ENS)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Enters weight and type of waste(manual currently but can be automated in real world deployment).<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Gets Paid!<br>
  
# Pay
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People can use the rewards claimed from Ecogift or their own crypto tokens to pay for various services offered by government. This can bring mass adoption among people. In this project we'll specifically use a example of **Recharging Metro Rail Card**


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Flow of this shall be**<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - User enters his address( but difficult for newbies. this is where we introduce ENS)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - If Balance is sufficient he can directly pay.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - If not, He can buy some crypto right there using **Ramp**<br>
 
## How is this Newbie friendly?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Clean and minimalistic UI with best sketches is used to build frontend. This ensures new users doesn't get lost or feel too complex to use Servvify**. Utmost care is taken for Clean and best UI possible. Any User from age of 13 to age of 70 can easily use Servvify. But first let me tell you some problems any user has when entering into Crypto and Blockchain.
* Buy Crypto in firstplace using Fiat
* Remember/Store complex Addresses
* Transfer crypto from exchanges to Wallet


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these are major bottle necks for mass adoption. Servvify has solutions to all of these problems.
* People can buy Crypto sing **RAMP** in DApp itself
* **ENS** is used to eliminate remembering/stroing addresses.
* **Polygon** which is Layer-2 network has very low gas fee and hogh transaction speed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will definitely help bypass all the hurdles for any user who wants to enter into Blockchain DApps and Crypto. **Ramp** ensures smooth onboarding for new users to buy crypto and surf through the decentralised world.

## How I built it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire DApp frontend is built using mainly JS and HTML. Smart Contracts are written in Solidity and deployed through Polygon network for high scalability. ENS is used for eliminating addresses and finally best feature **Ramp** is used to buy crypto in Servvify itself without going out exchanges like Coinbase, Binance.
